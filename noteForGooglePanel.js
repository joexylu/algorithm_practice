//         - Listen to the Interviewer
// ### How:
// Common Mistakes:
//     - Immediately jumping into code
//         - They want to see the process!
//         - Are you going down a dead end, they won't know
//         - Interviwewer can't give hints
//         - You'll waste time if you decide to start over
//     - Not testing or running through an example
//         - Discuss testing code verbally
//         - pick a example
//     - Not writing read code
//         - don't mix real code with pseudocode
//         - Whiteboard style
//     - Force fitting a solution
//         - Draw from experience
//         - Don't regurgitate something you've seen before: square peg => round hole
//     - Premature Optiumization
//         - Don't think that brute solutions aren't a good start, but do optimize after the implemetation is complete.
//     - Think: Data structures!!
//         - Bad programmers worry about cod. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships
// ### Tips:
// - Set a schedule! (and make it very specific, )
// - Do a lot of Leetcode
// - Communicate with your recruiter
// - For this type of problem, I will use this type of data set (Not the other way around)
// - JP Gonzalez, Lina Monsalve, Brandon Heath, Guillermina Muro
// - JP:
//     - Startup time: becoming a swiss army knife; WAY more pushes (Read: crunches)!
//     - Larger startup: Mix of the two, but with tons of learning
//     - Google: working in team, but specializing. Tons of communication required!
//     - Tip for interviewing: Know what the process is! (allow it to guide your study and time)
//         - Make it enjoyable for yourself!
//         - Change the medium with you need to.
// - How to stand out?
//     - Ability to navigate difficult/ambiguous situations
//     - Results and quantifible results (most important element)
//     - Leadership,
//     - Projects that you're working on, techs (definitely the ones you feel strongest with). (GITHUB SUPER IMPORTANT TO SHOW WORK, they do look)
// - Interview Prep:
//     - Leetcode (e/m/h problems, focus on time complexity)
//     - HankerRank
//     - Resources
// - Most common trouble questions:
//     - No such thing, instead its the common mistakes above that trip people up
// - How often are DS&A actually used on the job (unlike the interview process)?
//     - All the time! (must optimize to save battery life, customer experience, etc.)(JP)
// - How to find Google careers?
//     - Career section of website is always up to date
//     - Also, resumes are reviewed by a real person, not an ATS
// - Muro:
//     - Network event at the end of her bootcamp was how she got introduced to the Google process
//     - Whiteboard all the time!!! (Go to the Pairboarding sessions) (She couldn't recommend this enough)
// - JP:
//     - Interviewed in 2016, and failed
//     - continued working and learning
//     - Google reached back out to him to get him in the pipeline:
//         - Up to date Online Presence gave him the opportunity
//     - Prepare well to quell the nerves
//         - arrive early for the same reason
//     - Benefits of being an interviewer!!:
//         - Peak behind the process and start to understand the additional meanings behind interview questions
//     - Everyone in the pipeline wants you to do well.
//         - People want you to get the problem, to talk about the topics and tech, so be excited and share it.
// - Muro:
//     - Whiteboard in the lauguage that you're most comfortable in
//     - Didn't learn a new langauge for the interview process
// - JP:
//     - Didn't learn a new langauge for the interview process either
//     - Did learn other languages on the job only
//     - focus on being able to construct DS in whatever langauge you chose.
// - Muro:
//     - All coding, projects came up only once in the process (no project walkthough in the process)
//     - Talked a LOT about projects (open source and ) in developer relations interview
// - JP:
//     - no project walkthough in the process; no previous jobs brought up either
// - Lina:
//     - Recruiters look for passion (and GH is best for finding that out)
//     - Projects are there to find out your passions too.
//     - Projects are great to finding your team fit and interests.
// - Meetups and organizations:
//     - This event is a great example of what we do
//     - Find the tech events in the city that you're in and make yourself known
//     - Google often has a precence at those events (confs, and the like)
//     - Go to meetups becuase you want to be there, not because G will be there
// - Personal Project Time:
//     - 20% time on anything you like at Google
//     - JP: I have no side projects as I have a new babe, but there is plenty for time to do them
//     - Work life balance is great!
// - Anything that surprised you about the Google process:
//     - The openness of everything; It's not a secretive process, ask questions.
//     - Working there is the same way:
//         - everyone is supportive and understanding, mutual trust.
// - Closing thoughts:
//     - Muro: Everyone is nice and wants you to succeed!
